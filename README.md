# PyShell
 An embeddable python shell for your C++ programs. Utilizes Boost Python 
 
 Run CMake, and build for your platform. Use as any standard library. Example usage:
 
 cmake -G "MSYS Makefiles"; mingw32-make

I prefer
cmake -G "CodeBlocks - MinGW Makefiles"
but only because i can run my tests from codeblocks without worrying about dependency issues for the .exe
